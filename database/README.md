# Database & API Template

This directory contains the development standards and patterns for building robust data layers and GraphQL APIs.

## 🚀 Key Technologies
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary relational database for persistence.
- **Redis**: High-performance in-memory data store for caching and sessions.
- **GraphQL (Yoga + Pothos)**: Code-first GraphQL API with end-to-end type safety.
- **Prisma**: Type-safe ORM for PostgreSQL.
- **TypeScript**: Consistent typing from the database to the API.

## 📖 How to use
Refer to `CLAUDE.md` in this directory for specific development patterns and slash commands.
Refer to the root `skills.md` for overall architectural standards.
