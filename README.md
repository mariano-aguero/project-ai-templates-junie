# Claude Project Templates 🚀

This repository contains a collection of professional templates and advanced configurations specifically designed to optimize the workflow with **Claude Code** and other AI assistants.

The goal is to provide the AI with a rich context, senior-level technical standards, and modern architectural patterns to generate high-quality, secure, and scalable code.

## 📂 Project Structure

The repository is organized into specialized modules, each with its own memory configuration (`CLAUDE.md`) and standards:

- **[Next.js 15](./nextjs)**: Feature-based architecture, App Router, Server Components, and strict validation.
- **[Web3 & dApps](./web3)**: Smart contract development (Solidity), AppKit/Wagmi/Viem integration, and on-chain security.
- **[Database & API](./database)**: Data layer with PostgreSQL, Prisma, GraphQL (Pothos), Redis, and BullMQ.
- **[UI & Styling](./ui)**: Consistent components with **shadcn/ui** and **Tailwind CSS**.
- **[Security Audit](./audit)**: Methodologies and tools for smart contract security auditing.

## 🧠 The Heart: `skills.md`

At the root of the project is the **[skills.md](./skills.md)** file. This file centralizes:
- **Expert Personas**: Defined roles for different domains (Web Architect, Security Auditor, etc.).
- **Technical Standards**: Rules on data fetching, security, validation, and performance.
- **Quality Checklist**: A verification list that the AI assistant follows before delivering any task.

## 🚀 How to use this repository

To integrate these skills into your project:

1. Copy the `skills.md` and `.prettierrc` files to the root of your project.
2. Copy the template directory you need (e.g., `nextjs/`) or simply its `CLAUDE.md` file to the corresponding subdirectory of your project.
3. The AI assistant will automatically detect these configurations and adjust its behavior and code suggestions to the defined standards.
